One-line Summary: Initial tag for cesm1_0_3 release.

The previous release, cesm1_0_2, was based on the development tag
cam5_0_22.  The changes to the cam trunk which will be released in
cesm1_0_3 are summarized below.

New features in CAM5.1
======================

. Final bug fixes and tuning of CAM-FV w/ cam5 physics on 1 and 2 deg
  grids.

. All new diagnostics that are being produced for the CESM AR5
  contributions are available in this release.

. Update the COSP implementation to work with the cam5 physics package.

. The "CAM3.1" physics package has been restored.  Using the configure
  argument "-phys cam3" now gives a physics package that matches what was
  produced by the CAM3.1 model release.  This is mainly useful in an
  aquaplanet configuration since the land component cannot be reverted to
  CLM3.  To run an aquaplanet configuration that contains the
  customizations required by the intercomparison experiment protocol use
  the aquaplanet_cam3 use case (as an argument to build-namelist).

. Some tuning has been done to allow running the bulk aerosols with the
  cam5 physics package.  Either prescribed bulk aerosols (as used by the
  cam4 physics package) or prognostic bulk aerosols (via -chem trop_bam)
  can be used.  The motivation was to provide a less expensive cam5
  configuration which may be useful when modal aerosols are not the focus.

. The default for deposition velocity calculation is changed to be done in
  CLM except when modal aerosols are active.  This changes answers (but not
  climate) for all prognostic chemistry schemes affected by dry deposition.

. Extend unstructured grid functionality to chemistry and cam5 physics
  package (modal aerosols).  Because the modal aerosols are doing a dry
  deposition calculation on the atm grid, a new dataset is required when
  running SE on the cubed sphere grid (see namelist variable
  drydep_srf_file).

. Changes to chemistry code:
  - Provide more intuitive data-timing namelist variables.  See, for
    example, the new *_cycle_ry, *_fixed_ymd, *_fixed_tod variables.
  - Update trop_mozart with latest MOZART4 mechanism.
  - Restore lighting NOx production in super_fast_llnl.
  - Give flexibility to the units of the emissions datasets.
  - Use more up-to-date dataset for waccm_ghg forcing.
  - Include CO2 reactions for WACCM to improve concentrations in upper regions
  - Updates to dry deposition module.
  - Provide an additional optional wet deposition method for gas phase
    chemical species.
  - Include short wavelength photolysis in tropospheric chemistry.
  - New treatment of WACCM stratospheric aerosols.
  - New chemistry package added : trop_strat_bam_v1.
  - Adjustments to the trop_mozart chemistry mechanism.
  - Provide dynamic creation of default deposition species lists 
    namelist settings using master lists.
  - Correction to the wet deposition lists of species for 
    super_fast_llnl, and waccm_mozart.
  - Correction to the configure options for the offline driver regression test.

. Add new low resolution FV grid: 2.5x3.33.  The physics packages have not
  been tuned at this resolution.

. Change default for number of vertical remappings per physics timestep.
  Was 1, but now set to 2 for 1/2 deg FV and finer grids.  This changes
  answers for all high resolution (1/2 deg and finer) runs using FV dycore.

. Allow subcycling in Eulerian dycore.  See namelist variable eul_nsplit.

. Add ability to interpolate fields on the SE grid (cubed sphere) to a
  rectangular grid for history output.  See namelist variables
  interpolate_analysis, interp_nlat, interp_nlon, interp_gridtype, and
  interp_type.  This is off by default.

. Option for history output to be averaged over local time zones.  See
  namelist variables lcltod_start and lcltod_stop.

. Option for history output (columns) along a specified track.  See
  namelist variables sathist_track_infile, sathist_fincl, sathist_mfilt,
  and sathist_hfilename_spec. 

. Option for history output of multiple single columns.  The default is for
  single column specifications to be output as separate variables.  This
  option allows all single columns specified in a history file to be
  written as a single variable using the same format that is used to output
  unstructured grid data.  The option is enabled by the new namelist
  variable collect_column_output.  The reason for implementing this option
  is for efficiency in writing single column output.

. An option was added to the COSP simulator to allow it to be run on a
  subset of the timesteps when the radiation code is run.  See the namelist
  variable cosp_nradsteps.

. Add argument to configure (-fc_type) to allow specifying which type of
  Fortran compiler is being used when that compiler is being invoked via a
  generic script (e.g., mpif90 or ftn).  This is only needed for CAM
  standalone builds.

. Add argument to build-namelist (-ntasks) to produce default FV
  decomposition settings (npr_yz).  This functionality was previously
  embedded in the CESM scripts and was not available to user's of CAM
  standalone scripts.

Code cleanup and refactoring:
=============================

. Modify code to consistently save and reuse the physics buffer indicies
  rather than invoking a linear search for the indices wherever they are
  needed.

. Start refactoring modal_aer_opt module to make use of the rad_constituent
  interfaces.  This will eventually provide a prescribed modal aerosol
  capability and fully functioning diagnostic calculations for radiative
  forcing.

. Implement separate drivers for the cam5 macrophysics and microphysics.
  The driver for the cam4 macro/micro physics remains in stratiform.F90.

. Microphysics changes:
  - Remove unnecessary passed variables and use statements for the CAM5 cloud 
    microphysics (cldwat2m_micro.F90)
  - Add functionality for a logical flag called 'sub_column' to be passed to 
    the CAM5 microphysics that changes how it works, but with the flag set (false) 
    to reproduce the standard code (cldwat2m_micro.F90)

. Refactoring in cam history to allow for extra dimensions in output fields
  beyond the current spatial/temporal ones.  Previously the fields in a
  history file time sample only had (lon,lat,lev,time) or (ncol,lev,time)
  dimensions.  The "addfld" calls allowed lev to be set to 1, plev or
  plevp.  To work around this constraint in the past optional flags were
  added to the addfld subroutine that allowed more values of lev, but this
  workaround did not provide extra dimensions.  In cases where multiple
  non-horizontal dimensions were needed, e.g., level and optical depth, or
  level and subcolumn, the technique employed was to combine multiple
  dimensions into a single mixed dimension.  We have eliminated the need to
  do that (in the output field only -- internal data structures still
  require this mixed dimension).  Optional arguments have been added to the
  addfld subroutine which allow defining multiple dimensions rather than
  just a single "lev" dimension.

. Add new namelist groups to the dycores.  Continue to move namelist
  variables out of the generic cam_inparm group.

. The old ISCCP simulator has been removed.  The current ISCCP simulator is
  available as part of the COSP package.

Bugs fixed:
===========

. Bug fixes in cam5 micro/macro physics:
  - A fix to immersion freezing (small changes)
  - Fixing the diagnostic output FICE to trap for roundoff errors
    (diagnostic only) 
  - Bug fix for subgrid cloud water treatment in contact nucleation (small
    changes) 
  - Bug fix for size of snow particles used in radiation (they get smaller
    by a factor of 3 and more reflective: some impact). 
  - Fix to guarantee the in-stratus LWC to be within the specified range even
    when the cloud fraction is very small (<  1.e-5 ) 
  - Fix to prevent model crash by dividing by near zero cloud fraction in the
    droplet activation routine
    
. Bug fixes in chemistry code:
  - corrected vertically integrated wet deposition rates diagnostics
  - corrected MASS and AREA output fields
  - corrected chemical prod/loss rates diagnostics

. State variables now output time-averaged by default when "budget_history"
  is true.

. Fix a bug in call to conv_water_4rad that would lead to erroneous results
  with conv_water_in_rad=2 option if invoked.

Known bugs:
===========

. trop_mam7 currently not working.  This is a side effect of a partial code
  refactoring in modal_aer_opt.

Tag name: cesm1_0_rel_03_cam5_0_22
Originator(s): mvr
Date: 11 November 2010
One-line Summary: updated to trunk tag cam5_0_22; updated external definitions
to the release tags of the other components

Purpose of changes:

. Initial implementation of the COSP simulator for use with cam4 physics
  only. 

. Fix for the FV div4 filter.  This filter is only turned on by default for
  1/2 deg and higher resolution grids, so this change only affects answers
  for those resolutions.

. Set the lower boundary values of GHGs using the WACCM lower boundary file
  for all prognostic GHG chemistry schemes.  This changes answers beyond
  roundoff for WACCM runs and for trop_mozart.  It doesn't affect trop_mam3
  or the superfast_chem schemes.

. Fix to column pairing algorithm in phys_grid.  The bug would cause load
  balance problems, but not affect answers.

. Fix the prescribed GHG dataset for cam5 use case.  Enables historical run
  to go through the end of 2005.  This changes answers beyond roundoff for
  cam5 historical runs.

. Include workaround for extremely slow compilations with the intel
  compiler.

. Tuning mods for Eulerian T31 resolution used in paleoclimate simulations.

. Corrected the default settings for cam5 simulations at resolutions other
  than 1.9x2.5.  This changes answers beyond roundoff for all cam5
  simulations except those done at 1.9x2.5.
