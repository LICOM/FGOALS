One-line Summary: rewrite

Generalize to handle arbitrary numbers of dimensions and variables 
	with different dimensions but same names.   Remove unsupported
	command line options, add option -d which can be used to subset
	any dimension named in the file, for example -d lon:12:4 will
	compare variables dimensioned by lon from 12 to 15.

	Noted and corrected that some statistics did not take into
	account missing values (notably rdmax)
