CLM NCL script tools for analysis of CLM history files -- or for creation or
modification of CLM input files.

In order to make these scripts work in the testing framework the following must
be done.

1.) Respond to CSMDATA and CLM_ROOT as needed.
2.) Print a line with "success" after the work is completed.
	
Scripts available:

Master perl scripts that call the other ncl scripts:

getregional_datasets.pl ----- Extract out regional datasets from global ones and put files in a location that 
                              can be used by build-namelist.
runDepositionRegrid.pl ------ Runs the aerosol and nitrogen deposition regrid scripts for all valid resolutions
                              and simulation years.
cprnc.pl -------------------- Compare two NetCDF files to see if they are same or different.

NCL Scripts available:

getregional_datasets.ncl ---- NCL script to extract out regional datasets.
getco2_historical.ncl ------- Get historical CO2 to use for input in datm8 streams
pftdyntest2raw.ncl ---------- Convert pftdyn test datasets to rawdata format so can be 
                              used to create future datasets.
ndeplintInterp.ncl ---------- Create transient ndepdyn dataset from decadal average output
                              from CAM and convert the units to whats needed by CLM.
aerdepregrid.ncl ------------ Regrid the Aerosol deposition dataset to a different 
ndepregrid.ncl -------------- Regrid the Nitrogen deposition datasets to a different
			      resolution.  Uses bi-linear interpolation.
cprnc.ncl ------------------- Compare two NetCDF files to see if they are same or different.

pergroPlot.ncl -------------- Plots up ASCII files with RMS differences in them (from
                              one to five different files).
			      (Note: There are also sample RMS error perturbation growth
			      files, called RMS*.dat, that can be used with this)
