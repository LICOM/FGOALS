clm/tools/mkdatadomain/README		May/25/2011

The routines in this directory create a d???7 domain
file that can be used by either datm8 or docn8. It reads
in a global clm grid file and fractional file and then 
converts it to the format used by either datm8 or docn8.
The input grid file and fractional dataset should have been 
generated by the mkgriddata tool.

The following steps provide a method to create the executable
and generate the dataset:

0) create or svn export input data for clm grid dataset and clm fractional dataset.

1) cd to this directory 

2) run gmake

See Also: See the models/lnd/clm/tools/README file for notes about setting
          the path for NetCDF.

3) create namelist file :
   (a sample namelist is: mkdatadomain.namelist

   Required variables are:

     f_fracdata = Input CLM land fractional dataset.
     f_griddata = Input CLM grid dataset.
     f_domain   = Output data model domain file.

   Optional variables are:

     dtype = "docn" or "datm" to output ocean domain file or atmosphere domain file, respectively.

   make sure the datasets in the namelist correspond to the full path of where
   you downloaded your input datasets.

   Sample namelists (using /fs/cgd/csm as the root location where inputdata were exported) are:

   mkdatadomain.namelist   ----- Standard global dataset


4) run code (e.g.):
        mkdatadomain < mkdatadomain.namelist >&! mkdatadomain.out

5) move (and rename if appropriate) generated surface dataset
   to /fis/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/datm7/CLMNCEP, etc.

Important files:

  Makefile ---------------- GNU makefile
  Mkdepends --------------- Tool for Makefile to figure out code dependencies.
  Srcfiles ---------------- List of source files needed (includes files outside this directory)
  Filepath ---------------- Filepath location to source files needed
  mkdatadomain.namelist --- sample namelist
