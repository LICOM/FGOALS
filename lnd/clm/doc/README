Community Land Surface Model (CLM) version 4.0.32 -- source code, tools, 
offline-build and test scripts. This gives you everything you need
to run CLM with CESM with datm8 to provide NCEP forcing data in 
place of a modeled atmosphere.

What is new in this version of CLM (compared to previous CESM and CCSM releases)?

See the ChangeLog file for a summary description of the most recent major
version changes leading up to clm4_0_00, from CLM4.0.00 to CLM4.0.14, and then
from CLM4.0.14 to CLM4.0.32.  The User's Guide also has a section on this as well.
