clm/test/system/README						5/23/2011

Scripts for testing CLM and the CLM support tools with many different 
configurations and run-time options.

To use...

./test_driver.sh

(will then ask if you want to submit the script to the batch que)
On jaguarpf and lynx, compile first interactively and then submit.

 env CLM_JOBID=1001 ./test_driver.sh -c
 env CLM_JOBID=1001 ./test_driver.sh

interactive usage on all machines (runs a different list of tests):

env CLM_SOFF=FALSE ./test_driver.sh -i


Intended for use on NCAR machines: edinburgh.cgd, lynx, mirage/storm, bluefire, 
and ORNL machines: jaguar as well as ANL intrepid. And works on the MacBook laptop
yong.cgd. For most machines more than one compiler is supported.
 
Important environment variables

BL_ROOT ---------------- Root directory of CLM baseline code to compare to 
                         (if not set BL test will not be performed)
BL_TESTDIR ------------- Root directory of where to put baseline tests
CLM_ACCOUNT ------------ CLM account project number
CLM_INPUT_TESTS -------- Filename of file with list of tests to perform
CLM_TESTDIR ------------ Root directory of where to put most tests
CLM_RETAIN_FILES ------- If set to TRUE -- don't cleanup files after testing
CLM_FC ----------------- Use given compiler
CLM_JOBID -------------- Job identification number to use (rather than process ID)
CLM_THREADS ------------ Number of open-MP threads to use 
                         (by default this is set differently by machine)
CLM_SOFF --------------- If set to TRUE -- stop on first failed test

Important files:

test_driver.sh ------- Main test script
nl_files ------------- Directory with various namelists to test
config_files --------- Directory with various configurations to test
input_tests_master --- Master list of tests
tests_pretag_* ------- Tests for specific machines to do by default before a tag is done
tests_posttag_* ------ Tests for specific machines to do for more extensive testing 
                       after a tag is done
CLM_runcmd.sh -------- Figures out the run command to run the model
CLM_compare.sh ------- Compares output history files between two cases
T*.sh ---------------- Basic test script to do a specific type of test
gen_test_table.sh ---- Creates HTML table of tests
Makefile ------------- Will build the HTML table of tests
