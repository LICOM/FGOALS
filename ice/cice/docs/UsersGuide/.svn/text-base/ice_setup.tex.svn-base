The setup scripts for the coupled model are 
located in {\bf ccsm4/scripts}. The directory structure of CICE4
within CCSM is shown below.

\subsection{Coupled Model Scripts}
\label{coupled_scripts}

The CCSM4 scripts have been significantly upgraded from CCSM3 and are
based on a completely different design philosophy.  The new scripts will
generate a set of "resolved scripts" for a specific configuration determined
by the user. The configuration includes components, resolution, run type, and
machine. The run and setup scripts that were previously in the {\bf /scripts}
directory for CCSM3 are now generated automatically.  See the CCSM4 User's 
Guide for information on how to use the new scripts:\\

The file that contains the ice model namelist is now located in 
{\bf \$CASE/Buildconf}. The
script containing the environment variables used for building the executable
file for the ice model is also in {\bf \$CASE/Buildconf}.
The contents of the ice model namelist are described in section \ref{namelist}.
